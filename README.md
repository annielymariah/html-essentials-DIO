<h1 align="center">üìî HTML Essentials DIO ‚úíÔ∏è</h1>

This repository contains the Digital Innovation One (DIO) HTML challenge project. The goal of this challenge is to develop a basic website using the HTML tags learned during the practical classes, with the aim of putting into practice the knowledge acquired in structuring web pages.

## Challenge Objective

The goal of this challenge is to build a simple website that uses the HTML tags explained during the classes. The project seeks to reinforce the understanding of the use of basic elements and new suggested elements, through the creation of textual content and page structuring. The development of this challenge involves the following steps:

- Use some of the tags learned in the classes:
- `<h1> to <h6>`
- `<p>`
- `<mark>`
- `<small>`
- `<i>`
- `<u>`
- `<strong>`
- `<ol>`
- `<ul>`
- `<li>`
- `<a>`
- `<hr>`
- `<sub>`
- `<sup>`
- `<blockquote>`

- Use new suggested tags:
- `<font>`
- `<del>`
- `<abbr>`

The idea is to explore these tags, understand how they work and use them correctly to build rich and accessible content.
